# imageGetter_APOD-xkcdComic
The batch creates the image folder, runs the exe (or the runImageGetter.py) and downloads the pictures into the folder.
The image folder is removed everytime the batch is run. SO DONT CHANGE THE PATH TO ONE WITH IMPORTANT FILES NOR FOLDERS!

A sript to set up the Task Scheduler under Windows is not supported right now, but hopefully will be added in future.

The executable .exe file is built with <a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a>.
Other platform releases will ma ybe added in the future.
